Serious bugs

	- bx slider did not work because of conflicting versions of jquery, 1.8.2 and 1.7

	- bx slider did not work because of js.js being above bxslider.min.js, so that the bx functions were not loaded and could not be called

	- resize pearls

	- finish the last page 

	- redo the colors for the angular and shells

	- add missing photos

	- fix the pagers -  failed, assuming that another js is conflicting with the bxslider js and causing a distortation with the pager

	- add a pop up for the logo

	- link the boat to the last page / contact

	- find the correct font 

	- adding awesome font: make sure ot include the downloaded css or it won't work, not stated in the directions.
